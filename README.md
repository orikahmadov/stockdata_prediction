Documentation: Stock Trading Signal Predictor
Overview
This Python program uses historical stock data and machine learning to predict buy or sell signals for given stock symbols. It fetches historical stock data using the Yahoo Finance API, calculates various technical indicators, and trains a Random Forest Classifier model to generate trading signals. The program also evaluates the model's accuracy to provide an idea of its effectiveness.

Technical Indicators
The program calculates the following technical indicators:

Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Bollinger Bands (Upper and Lower)
These indicators help the model understand stock price trends and make predictions based on historical data.

Dependencies
To run the program, make sure to install the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
yfinance
scikit-learn
You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy yfinance scikit-learn
Usage
Modify the symbols list in the code to include the stock symbols for which you want to generate trading signals. By default, the list contains 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', and 'TSLA'.

You can adjust the timeframe variable to set the desired data frequency. The default is set to '1d' for daily data.

Run the program:

Copy code
python stock_signal_predictor.py
The program will fetch historical data for the specified symbols, calculate the technical indicators, train the model, and output the model's accuracy.

Finally, the program will print buy or sell signals for each stock symbol based on the trained model.

Example
With the default settings ('AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'TSLA' as symbols and '1d' as the timeframe), running the program will output something similar to the following:


Model accuracy: 0.75
{'AAPL': 'Buy', 'GOOGL': 'Sell', 'TSLA': 'Buy'}

This output means that the model has an accuracy of 0.75 (75%) and, based on its predictions, recommends buying AAPL and TSLA stocks and selling GOOGL stock. Please note that the model's accuracy and the generated signals might vary each time the program is run, depending on the latest stock data and the random state used during training.
